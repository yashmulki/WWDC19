/*:
 Welcome! Here, you will learn to work with microcontrollers by reading input from a circuit, processing it and performing a task based on it.
 
On the right is your circuit builder, where you can move around and connect components in order to create your circuit. Below, you will write your code. As you can see, there are two existing functions: setup and loop. Setup is where you designate which pins (I/O channels) are outputs and inputs, loop is where your code goes..
 
 The current circuit reads from a switch and turns on a light if the switch is on. Try turning on and off the switch, and read the comments below to understand how this works.
