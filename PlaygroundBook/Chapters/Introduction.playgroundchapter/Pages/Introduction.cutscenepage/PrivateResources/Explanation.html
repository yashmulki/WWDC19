		<div>A microcontroller is a small computer on an integrated circuit. A microcontroller usually includes a processor, memory and input-output (I/O) capabilities. As opposed to the microprocessors used in iPhones and Macs, microcontrollers are usually used in embedded systems, performing some specific task to enable a system to work. At the most fundamental level, microcontrollers gather input, process it, and produces output, interfacing with electrical and mechanical components.Â </div>
		<div>What is a Microcontroller?</div>
		<div>Where are they used?</div>
		<div>Everywhere! Microcontrollers' low cost and small size allow them to be used in an extremely diverse variety of applications, from controlling power tools to controlling automobile engines. When you start a load of laundry in a washing machine, a microcontroller controls the cycle. When you pour yourself a cup of coffee with a digital coffee machine, a microcontroller is controlling the entire process. When you flip open your Airpods, a microcontroller detects the opening and initiates pairing with your iPhone.</div>
		<div>Today, you're going to be learning how to program a microcontroller in Swift. You'll be using the popular Arduino open source microcontroller, which was designed for makers to quickly prototype new devices with an easy to use platform.
